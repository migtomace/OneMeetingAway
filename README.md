# OneMeetingAway

This Project seeks to develop an Android Application that brings convenience to the Alcoholics Anonymous Community.
Users will be able to open this app and see an array of meetings in their vicinity by using either the ListView or MapView.
They should have the ability to toggle back and forth between views, and have the capability to query days and times.

This app should feature: ['MapView', 'ListView', 'NavigationDrawer', 'Settings'...]
